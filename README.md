# Movie review app hobby project

A hobby project I created a while ago to learn React and serverless programming. The app is composed of a serverless backend that periodically scrapes the reviews from the web of the movies currently in theatres and a web UI for browsing the movies and links to the reviews. Features:

* React UI
* Redux state management
* Web UI deployed as a static website in a AWS S3 bucket
* REST API implemented using AWS API gateway and Node.js Lambda functions
* Data importers implemented using Lambda functions
* Data stored in AWS DynamoDB
* Automated deployment using Serverless Framework
* CloudWatch log streams for each lambda function
* Separate test and production environments
* JWT based authentication to access admin functions in the UI

The site is no longer live or maintained. This repo serves only for portfolio purposes.
